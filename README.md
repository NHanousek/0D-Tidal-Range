# BarraCUDA

## 0D Modelling of tidal range schemes eventually with a good amount of parallelisation and possibly CUDA too.

### Origins
Based off Jingjings rebuild of Reza's 0D model, but in C++ as opposed to Fortran with the aim of making a modern built and stored project.

### To do:
- Almost everything

### Note:
This model is mainly a learning project for me, testing the varius bits aong the way. Probably has at least six months before its anywhere near the existing model.
